# Gender Bias, Anaphora, and Pragmatics: â€‹
A Disentanglement Study in Machine Translation

We present an extended version of WinoMT data-set that covers other linguistic phenomena rather than just corefence, namely: anaphora, reordered sentence and only one profession in a sentence. 

We took 200 segments from winoMT anti-stereotypical dataset in English and using GPT, created the aforementioned sentences, with a total of 138 segments per phenomenon after a manual check and removal of those segments that did not make sense.

The extended version of the dataframe can be found on data/extended/
